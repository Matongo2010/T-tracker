### requirements

2. css
3. javascript

### how this app works.

There is a "click here" button at the bottom of the page. When you click on the button, a prompt will pop out and there you will put the value of side A, side B and side c. The output or the type of the triangle will depend on the valiues you have put in. If the three values are equal, the triangle will be an equilateral. If two values are equal, then the triangle will be an isosceless triangle and if neither of the sides is equal, the triangle will be a scalene triangle. Entering 0 as a value will give you an invalid answer.
