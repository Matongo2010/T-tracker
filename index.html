        <h1>The Triangle tracker</h1>

        <h2>What is a triangle?</h2>
        <p>In a simple explanation, a triangle is any plane figure with three straight sides and three angles.</p>
         <p>Therefore, a <strong>triangle tracker</strong> is an application which is meant to detect the type of triangle when user puts in the values of the three sides of the triangle.</p>

         <h2>Types of triangles:</h2>
         <h3>We have three types of triangles:</h3>
         <ol>
             <li><strong>Equilateral triangle</strong>This is a triangle that has three equal sides and equal angles.</li>
             <li><strong>Isosceles triangle </strong>This is a triangle that has two equal sides.</li>
             <li><strong>Scalene triangle </strong>This is a triangle that has three different angles and none of its three sides have equal length.</li>
         </ol>
